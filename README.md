My process
Built with

    Semantic HTML5 markup
    CSS custom properties
    Flexbox
    Responsive design using clamp() and viewport-relative units (vw)

    How to use clamp() for responsive margin and font sizes.

Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further refine my skills in:

    Advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid for layout.
    JavaScript integration for interactive components.
    Improving accessibility and SEO practices in web development.
